### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The main problem was finding out about and how to correctly use data structures.  The projects in this course helped me learn how to implement a number of common and core data structures.
### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I first determined what needed to be done.  This can help narrow what data structure to choose.  I then thought about how the progarm would be used by the user.  I determined that the user would search more often than any other option and so I choose to use a hash table.  data structures are important to understand, because it helps programs run both more efficiently and faster.
### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Whenever I would hit a road block I would use resources to help figure out what was wrong or what I should do.  The most common resources included: youtube, the textbook, and cplusplus.com
### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This course has really helped me understand data structures.  It changed the way I write programs.  I am now able to calculate the speed of an algorithm and choose a data structure that I think will fit the current program.
### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I understand that putting data in a proper structure will help it be more maintainable and easier to read.  It will also enable the program to run better.  I am able to utilize what I have learned here to make programs that are more adapatable, because I can make code that is able to handle data in a variety of ways.
